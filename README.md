# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview
Training  and evaluating  models with unbalanced classes in Credit risk Analysis
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily 
outnumber risky loans. RandomOverSampler, and SMOTE algorithms and undersampling 
the data using the Cluster Centroid algorithms combined with use a combinatorial 
approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEEN algorithms, we were able 
to predict credit risks in loan disbursement.

•	 Naive Random Oversampling acc score = 66.7%
